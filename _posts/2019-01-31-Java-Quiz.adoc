void[] voids = new void[1]; // <1>
Void[] voids = new Void[1]; // <2>
Void[] voids = { }; // <3>
Object voids = Array.newInstance(void.class, 1); // <4>
----
<1> a `void[]` isn't allowed.
<2> An array of any class is allowed even the `Void` class
<3> Also creates an empty `Void[]`
<4> This triggers a runtime error, but not a compile error. The compiler has very little knowledge of how libraries work and doesn't pick this up as an issue.
