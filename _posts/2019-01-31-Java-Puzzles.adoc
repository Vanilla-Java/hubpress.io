Here are some odd quiz questions in Java which might have interesting answers.

== Questions

=== void arrays

Which of the following doesn't compile

[source, Java]
----
void[] voids = new void[1]; // <1>
Void[] voids = new Void[1]; // <2>
Void[] voids = { }; // <3>
Object voids = Array.newInstance(void.class, 1); // <4>
----

See the answer at the end.

=== null reference

What does this do?

[source, Java]
----
Thread t = null; 
t.yield();
----

1. A compiler error
1. A runtime error
1. The JVM crashes
1. The JVM pauses briefly

What does this do?

== Answers

=== void arrays
[source, Java]
----
void[] voids = new void[1]; // <1>
Void[] voids = new Void[1]; // <2>
Void[] voids = { }; // <3>
Object voids = Array.newInstance(void.class, 1); // <4>
----
<1> a `void[]` isn't allowed.
<2> An array of any class is allowed even the `Void` class
<3> Also creates an empty `Void[]`
<4> This triggers a runtime error, but not a compile error. The compiler has very little knowledge of how libraries work and doesn't pick this up as an issue.

=== null reference

This code
[source, Java]
----
Thread t = null; 
t.yield();
----
is the same as
[source, Java]
----
Thread t = null; 
Thread.yield(); // the method is static
----

So the answer is 4 as it just pauses briefly.
