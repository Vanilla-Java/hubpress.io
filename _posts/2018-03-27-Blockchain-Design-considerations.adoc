After I announced the release of Chronicle Accelerate, a high throughput blockchain solution in Java. One of the questions which came up was; What were the design considerations that went into the solution, particularly around throughput vs latency?

Many of these design considerations are not specific to Blockchain or Java, but general performance tuning.
